/*
PMA (Password Management Aplication)

create a password management app that can create, delete and modify passwords and their description

things to considerate:

1.The app should begin by prompting the user for a master password. If the entered password is correct, it will grant access to the password vault containing all other passwords.
2.The app should display a list of the descriptions associated with each password.
3.When a password description is selected, the app reveals the associated password.
